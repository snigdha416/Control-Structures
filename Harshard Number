Program to check whether a number is a Harshad number or not (Niven number) is discussed here. Harshad Number is an integer that is divisible by the sum of its digits.

 a=int(input()) 
c=a
sum=0
for i in range (1,a):
    b=a%10 
    sum=sum+b
    a=a//10
if(c%sum==0):
    print('Harshad Number')
else:
    print('Not Harshad Number')
