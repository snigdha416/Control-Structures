Program to find prime numbers in a given range is discussed here. A number is said to be prime if it is divisible by 1 and the number itself. Program to find prime numbers in a given range using loop

a=int(input())
b=int(input())
for j in range(a,b+1):
    count=0
    for i in range(2,(j//2)+1):
        if j%i==0:
            count=count+1
    if count==0 and j!=1:
        print(j)
