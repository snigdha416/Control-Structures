Program to check whether the given number is a Palindrome or  Not a Palindrome is discussed here. Any number is said to be a palindrome if the original number and the reverse of the original number are the same.

For example, 1234321 is a palindrome.

Original number = 1234321

The reverse of the number = 1234321

a=int(input())
s=a
r=0
while a>0: 
    b=a%10
    r=r*10+b
    a=a//10
if(s==r): 
    print('Palindrome')
else:
    print('Not a Palindrome')
