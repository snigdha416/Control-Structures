Write a program to find the sum of digits in a given number. Program to find the sum of digits of the given number is discussed here. 
For example, let the input number be 719. The sum of digits of 719 = 7 + 1 + 9 = 17

n=int(input())
sum=0
for i in range(1,n+1):
    x=n%10
    sum=sum+x
    n=n//10
print(sum)
