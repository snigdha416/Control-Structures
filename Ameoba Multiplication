The environmental eco club  have discovered a new Amoeba that grows in the order of a Fibonacci series every month. They are exhibiting their amoeba in a national conference. They want to know the size of the amoeba at a particular time instant. If a particular month’s index is given can you write a  program that displays the amoeba’s size……???
//Use Dynamic Programming Strategy

i=int(input('Enter the number of Months \n'))
a=0
b=1
count=2
while count<i:
    c=a+b
    a=b
    b=c
    count=count+1
print('The amoeba size is \n',c)
